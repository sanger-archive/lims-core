    # This {Action} transfers the given fraction and type of aliquot from plate-like asset(s)
    # to plate-like asset(s).
    # It takes an array, which contains transfer elements.
    # An element has a source, source_location, target, target_location,
    # amount/fraction and aliquot_type parameters.
    # Source and targets are plate-like assets (plates, gel plates or tube racks).
    # The source/target_location is the well/window/tube location (like "A1") from
    # transfer the aliquots and to transfer the aliquots.
    # Amount is an amount of an aliquot to transfer.
    # Fraction is the fraction of an aliquot to transfer.
    # You should give the fraction OR the amount of the transfer, not both of them.
    # Aliquot_type is the type of the aliquot (DNA, RNA, NA, sample etc...).
